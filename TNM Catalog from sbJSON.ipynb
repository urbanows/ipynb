Derived from the NED using a hill shade technique, this base map represents a continental view showing shaded relief from USGS NED layers at resolutions of 1/3-, 1-, and 2-arc-second (in Alaska only). This hillshade is actually five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original terrain data. Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 0 45, 135 60, 270 45, 315 45, 45 45. These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation (shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 / 6). This equation gives double importance to the 315 degrees azimuth and 45 degrees altitude. Color characteristics are the result of applying a color ramp in which RGB values range from near-white (RGB: 255, 255, 252) to brown (RGB: 156, 142, 107). The color ramp was applied with a stretch type of 4.3 standard deviations, since the scale of brightness values range from 130 to 1240.

The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD.

The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For additional information on NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. Drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can be further subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data, respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds.

Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 0 45, 135 60, 270 45, 315 45, 45 45.

This product is designed to provide a seamless view of the data, closely resembling The National Map\\'s US Topo (GeoPDF) product at large scales, in a GIS accessible format. Orthoimagery data are typically high resolution aerial images that combine the visual attributes of an aerial photograph with the spatial accuracy and reliability of a map. Digital orthoimage resolution may vary from 6 inches to 1 meter. In the former resolution, every pixel in an orthoimage covers a six inch square of the earth\\'s surface, while in the latter resolution, one meter square is represented by each pixel. Blue Marble: Next Generation and Landsat imagery data sources are displayed at small to medium scales, however, the majority of the imagery service source is from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for the conterminous United States. The data is 1-meter pixel resolution with \"leaf-on\". Collection of NAIP imagery is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\\'s Farm Service Agency (FSA). In areas where NAIP data is not available other imagery may be acquired through partnerships by the USGS.

The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. Drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can be further subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data, respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds.
