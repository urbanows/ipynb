We grouped land cover types - ecological systems, human land use, and water - (subsequently referred to as map units) into forested, non-forested, and shrubland/woodland land cover types to create unique data layers. These data layers can then be buffered at specified distances to identify species' habitats. Aggregated map units can be compared and contrasted to identify areas of transition between these broad categories. They can also be used to identify core areas or contiguous blocks of similar type (i.e., interior) through buffering. This dataset was derived from the GAP National Land Cover data. Forested map units included deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, palustrine forested wetland, and estuarine forested wetland. Non-forested map units were defined as water, pasture/hay, agricultural areas, urban/developed, marshes, beaches, etc. Woodland/shrubland map units were defined as those ecological systems and land uses containing a majority of short, scrubby, woody vegetation or sparsely canopied treed vegetation. Forest edge was processed using ESRI Arc Macro Language scripts and reclass tables to facilitate the development of Forest edge. Although scripts were consistent nationwide, the reclass tables were region specific. Forest and nonForest classes are identified in landcover grid with a reclass table, and then focalmajority is used to remove small isolated pixels prior to buffering. Buffering is done with 2 grids; one for exterior buffers (FROM) and one for interior buffers (INTO). The forest edge data layer has unique aggregations of forest and non-forest map units. Utilizes Forest Interior: For species that require interior forest. Buffer distances must be identified to utilize this input. Avoids Forest Interior: For species that avoid interior forest. Buffer distances must be identified to utilize this input.

Items are identified in the Registry by an American Rivers ID, and that is used to retrieve the American Rivers subset from the system.',\n","   'distributionLinks': [],\n","   'id': '5735b874e4b0dae0d5df6bd1',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5735b874e4b0dae0d5df6bd1'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5735b874e4b0dae0d5df6bd1'}},\n","   'title': 'Dam Removal Information Portal 1.0: American Rivers Dam Removals'},\n","  {'body': \"The Land Cover Data - Version 1.0 represents a highly thematically detailed land cover map of the U.S. The map legend includes types described by NatureServe's Ecological Systems Classification (Comer et al. 2002) as well as land use classes described in the National Land Cover Dataset 2001 (Homer et al. 2007).

(PAD-US) is the nation\\'s inventory of protected areas, including public open space and voluntarily provided, private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastral Theme (http://www.fgdc.gov/ngda-reports/NGDA_Datasets.html). PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database of areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural, recreational or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase maps and describes public open space and other protected areas. Most areas are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, and agreements or administrative designations documented in agency management plans may be included. The PAD-US database strives to be a complete “best available” inventory of protected areas (lands and waters) including data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The dataset is built in collaboration with several partners and data providers (http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/stewards/). See Supplemental Information Section of this metadata record for more information on partnerships and links to major partner organizations. As this dataset is a compilation of many data sets; data completeness, accuracy, and scale may vary. Federal and state data are generally complete, while local government and private protected area coverage is about 50% complete, and depends on data management capacity in the state. For completeness estimates by state: http://www.protectedlands.net/partners. As the federal and state data are reasonably complete; focus is shifting to completing the inventory of local gov and voluntarily provided, private protected areas. The PAD-US geodatabase contains over twenty-five attributes and four feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services and analyses: Marine Protected Areas (MPA), Fee, Easements and Combined. The data contained in the MPA Feature class are provided directly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Protected Areas Center (MPA, http://marineprotectedareas.noaa.gov ) tracking the National Marine Protected Areas System. The Easements feature class contains data provided directly from the National Conservation Easement Database (NCED, http://conservationeasement.us ) The MPA and Easement feature classes contain some attributes unique to the sole source databases tracking them (e.g. Easement Holder Name from NCED, Protection Level from NOAA MPA Inventory). The \"Combined\" feature class integrates all fee, easement and MPA features as the best available national inventory of protected areas in the standard PAD-US framework. In addition to geographic boundaries, PAD-US describes the protection mechanism category (e.g. fee, easement, designation, other), owner and managing agency, designation type, unit name, area, public access and state name in a suite of standardized fields. An informative set of references (i.e. Aggregator Source, GIS Source, GIS Source Date) and \"local\" or source data fields provide a transparent link between standardized PAD-US fields and information from authoritative data sources. The areas in PAD-US are also assigned conservation measures that assess management intent to permanently protect biological diversity: the nationally relevant \"GAP Status Code\" and global \"IUCN Category\" standard. A wealth of attributes facilitates a wide variety of data analyses and creates a context for data to be used at local, regional, state, national and international scales. More information about specific updates and changes to this PAD-US version can be found in the Data Quality Information section of this metadata record as well as on the PAD-US website, http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/history/.) Due to the completeness and complexity of these data, it is highly recommended to review the Supplemental Information Section of the metadata record as well as the Data Use Constraints, to better understand data partnerships as well as see tips and ideas of appropriate uses of the data and how to parse out the data that you are looking for.

Building from work completed for the National Estuary Assessment, this approach includes: 1) information on fish and shellfish presence/absence from over 70,000 sampling events collected over two decades, to better relate fish habitat condition to natural and anthropogenic variables; 2) data on natural factors, to better incorporate information on the natural susceptibility of individual estuaries; and 3) regional datasets not available on a nationally-consistent basis. Methods for the assessment were developed through a collaborative process with regional partners. First, indicator screening models are used to rapidly screen a large number of potential stress variables against each species found in Gulf estuaries and identify the most important variables for further investigation. The models use the probability of fish presence (by species) to assess the significance of each estuary-level stress variable one at a time. These models also control for natural variables, such as temperature and salinity (collected concurrently with fish samples), which might otherwise obscure the effects of the stress variables. Once the most significant stress variables were identified from the screening models, they were tested using multi-stressor models for each fish species. Here, backwards selection eliminates variables one at a time from the model based on statistical significance, until only variables that are highly significant (i.e. at a 95% confidence level) remain. Using these more refined models, current conditions were then compared to the Least Disturbed Condition (LDC) - defined as the minimum observed value of each significant stressor across the entire region. By comparing against LDC, we can estimate the current impact of stressors and avoid extrapolating beyond the range of conditions for which the models were developed. Overall, this process allowed us to identify the most influential habitat stressors for each fish species and overall for estuaries in the northern Gulf of Mexico.',\n","   'distributionLinks': [],\n","   'id': '581a3de6e4b0bb36a4ca2f76',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/581a3de6e4b0bb36a4ca2f76'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=581a3de6e4b0bb36a4ca2f76'}},\n","   'title': '2015 Regional Estuary Assessment for the Northern Gulf of Mexico'},\n","  {'body': 'Some species respond to the amount of canopy cover within a habitat type.

We grouped land cover types - ecological systems, human land use, and water - (subsequently referred to as map units) into forested, non-forested, and shrubland/woodland land cover types to create unique data layers. These data layers can then be buffered at specified distances to identify species' habitats. Aggregated map units can be compared and contrasted to identify areas of transition between these broad categories. They can also be used to identify core areas or contiguous blocks of similar type (i.e., interior) through buffering. This dataset was derived from the GAP National Land Cover data. Forested map units included deciduous forest, evergreen forest, mixed forest, palustrine forested wetland, and estuarine forested wetland. Non-forested map units were defined as water, pasture/hay, agricultural areas, urban/developed, marshes, beaches, etc. Woodland/shrubland map units were defined as those ecological systems and land uses containing a majority of short, scrubby, woody vegetation or sparsely canopied treed vegetation. Forest edge was processed using ESRI Arc Macro Language scripts and reclass tables to facilitate the development of Forest edge. Although scripts were consistent nationwide, the reclass tables were region specific. Forest and nonForest classes are identified in landcover grid with a reclass table, and then focalmajority is used to remove small isolated pixels prior to buffering. Buffering is done with 2 grids; one for exterior buffers (FROM) and one for interior buffers (INTO). The forest/open only ecotone does not consider environments with sparse canopies or scrubby vegetation, therefore this data layer includes woodland and shrubland map units that would otherwise be ignored. This dataset uses 2 data layers in tandem. The forest/open ecotone and the woodlands/shrublands (i.e., wlsl) are calculated individually and then combined to depict a landscape that includes both ecotones. Ecotone Width: This distance represents a symmetrically buffered edge (i.e., 0, 30, 60, 120, 250, 500, and 1000 meters). For example, an ecotone width of 500 meters includes 250 meters into forest and 250 meters into open. Buffer distances - Distances into ecotone (e.g., forest edge): 0, 30, 60, 120, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and &gt;4000 meters Distances away ecotone (e.g., forest edge: &gt;4000, 4000, 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 120, 60, 30 and 0 meters These data are divided into 6 regions across the US (Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, Upper Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast).

These include water type (i.e. flowing, open/standing), distance to and from water, and stream flow and underlying gradient. The source for this data was the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)(USGS 2007). Hydrographic features were divided into three types: flowing water, open/standing water, and wet vegetation. These feature types were extracted from the NHD by selecting the corresponding codes (the FCODE attribute) in datatables and creating seperate datasets for each data type. To facilitate their use in spatial modeling, these feature types were converted into grids and combined into 16 catagories where feature types overlapped.

Data from four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project were combined to make this dataset. In the northwestern United States (Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington and Wyoming) data in this map came from the Northwest Gap Analysis Project. In the southwestern United States (Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) data used in this map came from the Southwest Gap Analysis Project. The data for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia came from the Southeast Gap Analysis Project and the California data was generated by the updated California Gap land cover project. The Hawaii Gap Analysis project provided the data for Hawaii. In areas of the county (central U.S., Northeast, Alaska) that have not yet been covered by a regional Gap Analysis Project, data from the Landfire project was used. Similarities in the methods used by these projects made possible the combining of the data they derived into one seamless coverage. They all used multi-season satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) from 1999-2001 in conjunction with digital elevation model (DEM) derived datasets (e.g. elevation, landform) to model natural and semi-natural vegetation. Vegetation classes were drawn from NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer et al. 2003) or classes developed by the Hawaii Gap project. Additionally, all of the projects included land use classes that were employed to describe areas where natural vegetation has been altered. In many areas of the country these classes were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). For the majority of classes and, in most areas of the country, a decision tree classifier was used to discriminate ecological system types. In some areas of the country, more manual techniques were used to discriminate small patch systems and systems not distinguishable through topography. The data contains multiple levels of thematic detail. At the most detailed level natural vegetation is represented by NatureServe's Ecological System classification (or in Hawaii the Hawaii GAP classification). These most detailed classifications have been crosswalked to the five highest levels of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC), Class, Subclass, Formation, Division and Macrogroup. This crosswalk allows users to display and analyze the data at different levels of thematic resolution. Developed areas, or areas dominated by introduced species, timber harvest, or water are represented by other classes, collectively refered to as land use classes; these land use classes occur at each of the thematic levels.&nbsp;<br>\\nTo download the most current version of the GAP/LANDFIRE land cover dataset, visit the Gap Analysis Project website: https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap.\",\n","   'distributionLinks': [{'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'KML Service',\n","     'type': 'kml',\n","     'typeLabel': 'KML Download',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/527d09f1e4b0850ea0518313?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase WMS Service',\n","     'type': 'serviceCapabilitiesUrl',\n","     'typeLabel': 'OGC Service Capabilities URL',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/527d09f1e4b0850ea0518313?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0'}],\n","   'id': '527d09f1e4b0850ea0518313',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/527d09f1e4b0850ea0518313'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=527d09f1e4b0850ea0518313'}},\n","   'title': 'U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Project- Land Cover Data v2.2'},\n","  {'body': 'The USGS Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is the nation\\'s inventory of protected areas, including public land and voluntarily provided private protected areas, identified as an A-16 National Geospatial Data Asset in the Cadastre Theme (https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-cadastre/). The PAD-US is an ongoing project with several published versions of a spatial database including areas dedicated to the preservation of biological diversity, and other natural (including extraction), recreational, or cultural uses, managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The database was originally designed to support biodiversity assessments; however, its scope expanded in recent years to include all public and nonprofit lands and waters. Most are public lands owned in fee; however, long-term easements, leases, agreements, Congressional (e.g. \\'Wilderness Area\\'), Executive (e.g. \\'National Monument\\'), and administrative designations (e.g. \\'Area of Critical Environmental Concern\\') documented in agency management plans are also included. The PAD-US strives to be a complete inventory of public land and other protected areas, compiling \"best available\" data provided by managing agencies and organizations. The PAD-US geodatabase maps and describes areas with over twenty-five attributes in nine feature classes to support data management, queries, web mapping services, and analyses. This PAD-US Version 2.0 dataset includes a variety of updates and changes from the previous Version 1.4 dataset. The following list summarizes major updates and changes: 1) Expanded database structure with new layers: the geodatabase feature class structure now includes nine feature classes separating fee owned lands, conservation (and other) easements, management designations overlapping fee lands, marine areas, proclamation boundaries and various \\'Combined\\' feature classes (e.g. \\'Fee\\' + \\'Easement\\' + \\'Designation\\' feature classes); 2) Major update of the Federal estate including data from 8 agencies, developed in collaboration with the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Federal Lands Working Group (FLWG, https://communities.geoplatform.gov/ngda-govunits/federal-lands-workgroup/); 3) Major updates to 30 States and limited additions to 16 other States; 4) Integration of The Nature Conservancy\\'s (TNC) Secured Lands geodatabase; 5) Integration of Ducks Unlimited\\'s (DU) Conservation and Recreation Lands (CARL) database; 6) Integration of The Trust for Public Land\\'s (TPL) Conservation Almanac database; 7) The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Lands database update: the national source of lands owned in fee or managed by TNC; 8) National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) update: complete update of non-sensitive (suitable for publication in the public domain) easements; 9) Complete National Marine Protected Areas (MPA) update: from the NOAA MPA Inventory, including conservation measure (\\'GAP Status Code\\', \\'IUCN Category\\') review by NOAA; 10) First integration of Bureau of Energy Ocean Management (BOEM) managed marine lands: BOEM submitted Outer Continental Shelf Area lands managed for natural resources (minerals, oil and gas), a significant and new addition to PAD-US; 11) Fee boundary overlap assessment: topology overlaps in the PAD-US 2.0 \\'Fee\\' feature class have been identified and are available for user and data-steward reference (See Logical_Consistency_Report Section).

Where possibilities for river restoration, or improved safety, exceed the benefits of retaining a dam, removal is more often being considered a viable option. Yet, as this is a relatively new development in the history of river management, science is just beginning to guide our understanding of the physical and ecological implications of dam removal. Ultimately, however, deciding if and how to remove aging dams should be guided by “lessons learned” from previous studies that have examined the ecosystem effects of dam removal. We are creating a dynamic database that organizes published scientific information relevant to dam removal in the United States for the purposes of analyzing the type of scientific research and data collection related to dam removal projects. The database contains: (1) attributes of removed dams (for example, their height and volume), (2) removal methodologies, (3) monitoring information, and (4) ecosystem responses to removal. This database links to existing USGS data sources (for example, stream gaging and national hydrography datasets), and supports data summary and visualization tools provided through the <a href=\"https://www.sciencebase.gov/drip/\">Dam Removal Information Portal</a>. The creation of this “metaknowledge” database provides managers, stakeholders, and the public with the information necessary to make informed decisions about dam decommissioning..',\n","   'distributionLinks': [],\n","   'id': '55afef65e4b09a3b01b52894',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/55afef65e4b09a3b01b52894'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=55afef65e4b09a3b01b52894'}},\n","   'title': 'National Dam Removal Science Database'},\n","  {'body': 'A collection of photographs that are used in compositions and reports throughout the BIS. &nbsp;',\n","   'distributionLinks': [{'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'KML Service',\n","     'type': 'kml',\n","     'typeLabel': 'KML Download',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=childrenBoundingBox,children'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase WMS Service',\n","     'type': 'serviceCapabilitiesUrl',\n","     'typeLabel': 'OGC Service Capabilities URL',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase Collection JSON',\n","     'type': 'repo',\n","     'typeLabel': 'ScienceBase Repository',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa&format=json'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase Collection ATOM',\n","     'type': 'repo',\n","     'typeLabel': 'ScienceBase Repository',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa&format=atom'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase Collection CSV',\n","     'type': 'repo',\n","     'typeLabel': 'ScienceBase Repository',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/items?parentId=56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa&format=csv'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase OAI PMH Service',\n","     'type': 'oai-pmh',\n","     'typeLabel': 'OAI-PMH',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/oai-pmh?verb=ListRecords&metadataPrefix=fgdc-orig&set=56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase CSW Service',\n","     'type': 'csw',\n","     'typeLabel': '',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa/csw?service=CSW&version=2.0.2&request=GetRecords'}],\n","   'id': '56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=56bbbdd8e4b08d617f6579aa'}},\n","   'title': 'BIS Photo Collection'},\n","  {'body': 'Placeholder for metadata',\n","   'distributionLinks': [],\n","   'id': '5bacf0e3e4b08583a5d10c7f',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5bacf0e3e4b08583a5d10c7f'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5bacf0e3e4b08583a5d10c7f'}},\n","   'title': 'National Phenology Network -- Phenocasts'},\n","  {'body': 'Some species respond to environments directly related to altitudinal variation.

S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program, that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. Please note that PAD-US version 1.4 is now the most current version available. Please access PAD-US 1.4 here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus/data/. The geodatabase contains four feature classes such as, \\x91Marine Protected Areas (MPA)\\x92 and \\x91Easements\\x92 that each contains uniquely associated attributes. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US \\x91Fee\\x92 feature class to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema (i.e. \\x91Combined\\x92 file). Legitimate and other protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory, with Easements loaded on top of Fee and MPAs under both. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved in this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate analytical layers to summarize area statistics for \"GAP Status Code\" and \"Owner Name\". Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area\\'s inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre\\'s World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, \"A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values\" and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. The geodatabase contains a Marine Protected Area (MPA) feature class and Easements feature class, each with uniquely associated attribute. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US fee feature class with standard PAD-US attributes to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema. As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory GAP creates separate analytical layers to obtain area statistics for \"GAP Status Code\" and \"Owner Name\". PAD-US version 1.3 Combined updates include: 1) State, local government and private protected area updates delivered September 2011 from PAD-US State Data Stewards: CO (Colorado State University), FL (Florida Natural Areas Inventory), ID (Idaho Fish and Game), MA (The Commonwealth\\'s Office of Geographic Information Systems, MassGIS), MO (University of Missouri, MoRAP), MT (Montana Natural Heritage Program), NM (Natural Heritage New Mexico), OR (Oregon Natural Heritage Program), VA (Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia Natural Heritage Program). 2) Select local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas (3,632) across the country (to complement the current PAD-US inventory) aggregated by the Trust for Public Land (TPL) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation finance movement across the country. 3) A new \\x93Date of Establishment\\x94 field that identifies the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, attributed for 86% of GAP Status Code 1 and 2 protected areas. Additional dates will be provided in future updates. 4) A national wilderness area update from wilderness.net 5) The \\x94Access\\x94 field that describes public access to protected areas as defined by data stewards or categorical assignment by Primary Designation Type. . The new \\x93Access Source\\x94 field documents local vs. categorical assignments. See the PAD-US Standard Manual for more information: gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus 6) The transfer of conservation measures (i.e. GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories) and documentation (i.e. GAP Code Source, GAP Code Date) from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorical assignments (see PAD-US Standard) when not provided by data stewards 7) Integration of non-sensitive National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) easements from August 2011, July 2012 with PAD-US version 1.2 easements. Duplicates were removed, unless \\'Stacked\\' = Y and multiple easements exist. 8) Unique ID\\'s transferred from NCED or requested for new easements. NCED and PAD-US are linked via Source UID in the PAD-US version 1.3 Easement feature class. 9) Official (member and eligible) MPAs from the NOAA MPA Inventory (March 2011, www.mpa.gov) translated into the PAD-US schema with conservation measures transferred from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorically assigned to new protected areas. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for documentation of categorical GAP Status Code assignments for MPAs. 10) Identified MPA records that overlap existing protected areas in the PAD-US Fee feature class (i.e. PADUS Overlap field in MPA feature class). For example, many National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks are also MPAs and are represented in the PAD-US MPA and Fee feature classes.(ei',\n","   'distributionLinks': [{'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ArcGIS REST Service',\n","     'type': 'serviceLink',\n","     'typeLabel': 'Service Link',\n","     'uri': 'http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Owner/MapServer'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'KML Service',\n","     'type': 'kml',\n","     'typeLabel': 'KML Download',\n","     'uri': 'http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Owner/MapServer/kml/mapImage.kmz'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ArcGIS WMS Service',\n","     'type': 'serviceLink',\n","     'typeLabel': 'Service Link',\n","     'uri': 'http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/services/gap/PADUS_Status/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS'}],\n","   'facets': [{'boundingBox': {'maxX': 179.9999885408441,\n","      'maxY': 71.38954260005058,\n","      'minX': -179.9999885408441,\n","      'minY': -14.609479036376571},\n","     'className': 'gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ArcGisRestServiceFacet',\n","     'enabledServices': ['KmlServer', 'WMSServer'],\n","     'facetName': 'ArcGIS REST Service',\n","     'url': 'http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Status/MapServer'},\n","    {'boundingBox': {'maxX': 179.99998854118684,\n","      'maxY': 71.38954260005066,\n","      'minX': -179.99998854118684,\n","      'minY': -14.609479036376559},\n","     'className': 'gov.sciencebase.catalog.item.facet.ArcGisRestServiceFacet',\n","     'enabledServices': ['KmlServer'],\n","     'facetName': 'ArcGIS REST Service',\n","     'url': 'http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Owner/MapServer'}],\n","   'id': '527d09cae4b0850ea051830b',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/527d09cae4b0850ea051830b'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=527d09cae4b0850ea051830b'}},\n","   'title': 'Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) - Combined: Version 1.3'},\n","  {'body': \"Environments dominated by human disturbance such as roads, cities, and the constructed materials that support human habitation have profound effects on species. For most species, this data layer was used to exclude species from a portion of the landscape. However, some species respond favorably to human habitats, therefore this data layer was used in an inclusionary manner. The human impact avoidance dataset describes high exclusion/high inclusion proximity to urban environments, and roads. This dataset was derived from US Census TIGER/Line files and GAP’s National Land Cover Database developed by USGS, in particular the impervious dataset. These data are divided into 6 regions across the US (Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, Upper Midwest, Southeast, and Northeast). If you want complete coverage of the entire US, all 6 regional files are needed. These raster data have a 30 m x 30 m cell resolution. Level of avoidance: High - For species that are very intolerant of human disturbance. All portions of the landscape identified as being directly influenced by human disturbance are eliminated from the predicted distribution. Medium - For species that are moderately intolerant of human disturbance. Only portions of the landscape identified as being highly or moderately influenced by human disturbance are eliminated from the predicted distribution. Low - For species that are partially intolerant of human disturbance. Only portions of the landscape identified as being highly influenced by human disturbance are eliminated from the predicted distribution. No selection of this parameter indicates the species' model is not contingent on an index of human disturbance. This human impact avoidance data set is considered official foundational data for the GAP species modeling process. The data have been made available provisionally to enhance understanding and use of GAP species data.&nbsp;These data represent circa 2001 ground conditions.\",\n","   'distributionLinks': [{'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'KML Service',\n","     'type': 'kml',\n","     'typeLabel': 'KML Download',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5540e099e4b0a658d79395d6?mode=download&request=kml&service=wms&layers=footprint'},\n","    {'files': '',\n","     'name': '',\n","     'rel': 'alternate',\n","     'title': 'ScienceBase WMS Service',\n","     'type': 'serviceCapabilitiesUrl',\n","     'typeLabel': 'OGC Service Capabilities URL',\n","     'uri': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalogMaps/mapping/ows/5540e099e4b0a658d79395d6?service=wms&request=getcapabilities&version=1.3.0'}],\n","   'id': '5540e099e4b0a658d79395d6',\n","   'link': {'rel': 'self',\n","    'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5540e099e4b0a658d79395d6'},\n","   'relatedItems': {'link': {'rel': 'related',\n","     'url': 'https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/itemLinks?itemId=5540e099e4b0a658d79395d6'}},\n","   'title': 'USGS Gap Analysis Project - Additional Data – Human Impact Avoidance'},\n","  {'body': \"The Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) is part of a hierarchical classification system for surface water drainage in the US (Seaber et al. 1987).

Two versions of each modeling region were created one in which a buffer was applied to remove boundary issues when calculating metrics based on neighborhoods, and a version used to clip the final model output for that region tightly to the region boundary.
